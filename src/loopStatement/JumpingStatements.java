	//There are mainly three different types of jumping statements available in Java:
	//1. break statement : it is going to break the loop and jump to the last iteration.
	//2. continue statement: it will help us to skip the current iteration only and continue with next iteration
	//3. return statement : it will help us to exit from the method. Optionally, you can return the value also.
