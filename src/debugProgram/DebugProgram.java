	// How to debug a program :
	
	// 1.Step 1: Identify the error &  line number (first line of error will tell you the root cause, last line is where it actually failed)
	// 2.Step 2: Add breakpoints at the line before the error line (breakpoint : a marker to pause the execution at that line)
	// 3.Step 3: Run the program in debug mode (Run -> Debug As -> Java Application)

		System.out.println("Step2: Preparing to execute next step");
		System.out.println("Step3: Performaing calculations");
		
		int j = 0;
		int x = i/j;
		System.out.println("Step4: Program execution completed"+x);

	//Debug Options in Eclipse:

	//1.Resume (F8) : Continue execution until the next breakpoint or end of program
	//2.Terminate : Stop the execution of the program
	//3.Step Into (F5) : Go into the method being called at the current line
	//4. Step Return (F7) : Complete the current method and return to the calling method
	//5. Step Over (F6) : Execute the current line and move to the next line in the same method
